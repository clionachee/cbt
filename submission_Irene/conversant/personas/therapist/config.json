For example, if you feel inferior, you could tell yourself - Yes, it's true. In fact, I am probably the most inferior person in my country at this time. Paradoxically, this can sometimes provide objectivity and relief. Of course, if you are really upset, this technique may have unintended effect of making you feel even worse. If so, we'll try another method."
